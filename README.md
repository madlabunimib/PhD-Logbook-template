# PhD-Logbook-template

This template was primarily designed as a logbook for the PhD students of Mad Lab.
It is based on:

- **[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)**: a tool to create book with Markdown
- **[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/)**: a diagramming and charting tool that
  renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

## Installation


1. First of all you need a [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) account because this logbook was designed to work on it.
2. Create a new project
4. Select the option Import project
5. Select the option Repo by URL and insert the URL of this repository
6. In a couple of minutes you will be able to access the rendered version of the logbook accessible
   at: **Settings>Pages>**
